## How to Solve Programming Problems?
 

 1. Read the problem completely twice: You want to make sure you completely understand the problem.  A good test of this is whether or not you can explain the problem to someone else.
 2. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data : It is very important to solve the problem manually first, so that you know what you are going to automate, otherwise you are just slinging code around.
 3. Optimize the manual steps: What you want to do here is figure out if there is another way you can solve the problem easier, or if there are some steps you can cut our or simplify.
 4. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code: What we want to do here is capture all the steps we created and now either put them into our editor as comments or write them as psuedo-code that we can translate to real code.
 5. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code: All we do here is take each comment and convert it into a real line of code.
 6. Optimize the real code: Sometimes this step isn’t necessary, but it’s worth taking a look at your code and figuring out if you can cut out a few lines or do something simpler.
 

## How to Use the 5 Whys?
1. Assemble a Team: Gather together people who are familiar with the specifics of the problem.
2. Define the Problem: observe the problem in action. Discuss it with your team and write a brief, clear problem statement that you all agree on.
3. Ask the First "Why?": Ask your team why the problem is occurring.
4. Ask "Why?" Four More Times: For each of the answers that you generated in Step 3, ask four further "whys" in succession. Each time, frame the question in response to the answer you've just recorded.
5. Know When to Stop: You'll know that you've revealed the root cause of the problem when asking "why" produces no more useful responses, and you can go no further.
6. Address the Root Cause(s): you need to discuss and agree on the counter-measures that will prevent the problem from recurring.
7. Monitor Your Measures: Keep a close watch on how effectively your counter-measures eliminate or minimize the initial problem.
