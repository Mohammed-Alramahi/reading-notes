# SQL

## What is SQL?

**SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a language designed to allow both technical and non-technical users query, manipulate, and transform data from a relational database. And due to its simplicity, SQL databases provide safe and scalable storage for millions of websites and mobile applications.**

## Relational databases

**A relational database represents a collection of related (two-dimensional) tables. Each of the tables are similar to an Excel spreadsheet, with a fixed number of named columns (the attributes or properties of the table) and any number of rows of data.**

## How to retrieve data from a table?

```sql
  Select * from user;
```

## WHERE Clause

**In order to filter certain results from being returned, we need to use a WHERE clause in the query. The clause is applied to each row of data by checking specific column values to determine whether it should be included in the results or not.**

```sql
 Select * from student where instructor='Mahmoud Khudairi';
```
