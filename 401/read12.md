# Socket.io

## What is the benefit of transforming data into packets?

* packets are the most basic units of communication over TCP/IP networks

* data are being divided into smaller pieces

* sending a smaller units of data helps us with the transmission of data

## UDP is often referred to as a connectionless protocol. Why is this?

 because no connection needs to be established between the source and destination before you transmit data.

- Can a socket server application have multiple socket connections? Yes.

- Can a socket connection application be connected to multiple socket servers? Yes.

- Can an application be both a socket server and a socket connection? No, that's near impossible (from stackoverflow)

### Observer Pattern

A software design pattern where an object has dependents called observers that are notified about events that happen to the object

### Listener

listeners wait for some kind of event to happen upon objects

### Event Handler

a function that is called upon event

### Event Driven Programming

programming pattern that depends on events as opposed to objects

### Event Loop

a design pattern that gets triggered and reacts to events by watching the callback queue and call stack.

### Event Queue

A queue that contains the operations that would be executed.

### Call Stack

The call stack contains the order that an interpreter needs to perform called functions

### Emit/Raise/Trigger

used to call an event

### Subscribe

to listen and wait for a certain event

### database

a database is an organized collection of data stored and accessed electronically from a computer system
