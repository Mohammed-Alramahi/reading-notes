# Event Driven Applications

## Why access control is important?

Access control is considered as a mask of security that control access to information or functionality and it is more significant to control who approaches private information and who can make changes onto them.

## Describe an application that would need access control

Any application that has some serious information to keep it safe from the hands of unauthorized people like canvas for example where instructors and students can access different pages.

## What is a role used for?
