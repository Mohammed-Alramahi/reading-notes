## Introductory HTML and JavaScript
***
**Every website is built up using Html and CSS along with some technologies like PHP depending on the website size and functions**

**DNS (Domain Name Server) Servers** are used to locate the physical location of a server so whenever you try to visit a website your browser will ask the DNS for its location after that you can view the page

When you want to build a website think about it as if you reading a newspaper that in newspapers there are the headings, images, and articles related to some news when it comes to websites it's gonna be pretty much the same but with a more interactive view. So websites consist of headings, Images, sometimes audio or video, etc.
***
**Very basic HTML5 structure:(Where HTML is the main tool used to structure websites)**

`<!DOCTYPE html>`

`<html>`

`<head>`

 `<title>`Example page`</title>`

`</head>`

`<body>`

 `<header>`

`<h1>`This is main heading `</h1>`

`</header>`
 
 `<main>`

`<p>`Hello World!`<p>`

`</main>`

`</body>`

`<footer>` This is Footer `</footer>`

`</html>`
***
*Note that every HTML tag has an opening and closing tags except for some of them like `<img>` tag.*

**Every good developer marks his code with comments that other developers can relate to it more efficiently and to write comments in HTML you simply type `<!-- Here goes the comment -->`**
***
The main difference between `id` and `class` attributes is `id` will uniquely identify the element that will not be repeated in a page or other pages like the header where most likely you will have one header, You can have multiple blog posts for example and that's when you use `class` because it will be applicable for more than one element.

Block elements: Elements that will be at the start of the line and will cover the whole of it.
Inline elements: Elements will be a series neighboring each other at the same line covering only the needed area, unlike block elements.

`<meta>` tag is used to provide additional hidden information about the website like SEO(Search Engine Optimization) for instance.

**HTML5 semantic tags give a better understanding of its usage by its name so it's better to use them when you can!**

*We use Javascript to make the website more interactive and load contents without the need to refresh the page, which is considered very powerful.*

**Script is series of steps that teach the computer what to do.**

  - Think of it as a puzzle to solve.
 2. Designing the script.
