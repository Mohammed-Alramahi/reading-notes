# Images

**We can do anything with Images that we can do with other elements like:**

- Width and height:

```css
img{
    width:420px;
    height:380px;
}
```

- Alignment:

 ```css
 /*This will take image to position it on left side*/
 img{
 float:left;
 margin:5px;
 }
/*This will take image to position it on right side*/
img{
    float:right;
    margin:5px;
}
/*Or we can put the image in the center by a trick*/
 img{
     display:block;
     margin:0 auto;
 }
 
 ```

 - Background Images let's say for the whole body:
 
 ```css
body{
    /*Make sure to specify the url correctly*/
    background-image:url('img/img1.png');
}

   /*We can also remove the default repeated background attribute*/
body{
   background-image:url('img/img1.png');
   background-repeat:no-repeat;
}
 ```

- Etc.
