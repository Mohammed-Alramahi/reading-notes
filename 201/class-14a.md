**Imagine you were asked to pick one of two groups:**

- Team A consists of people who are all exceptionally smart and successful and When you see a video of this group working, you see professional hard workers who waits till a topic arises in which they are expert, and then they speak at length, explaining what the group should do.

- Team B is different. Itâ€™s evenly divided between successful executives and middle managers with few professional accomplishments. They do everything chaotically and they almost don't respect the other point of view regarding something they discussed on.

**on which team you are playing?**
