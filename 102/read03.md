- `<header>`: where the headings go and it will be on the top area of the page.
- `<main>`: most of the html body goes in there.
- `<nav>`: site links area or navigational urls.
- `<section>`: works like `<div>` but it's semantic.
- `<footer>`: the bottom of the page area.
- id and class tag attributes: the main difference between them that class can be applied with any element while id will uniquely identify specific element.
