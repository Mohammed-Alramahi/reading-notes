# markdown 
***
deal with things pretty much like html but on github.
In this read I learned that`(**Hello world**)` or `(__Hello world__)` will give my text a bold style.
for images we will write `![facebook profile picture](/images/myprofileimg.jpg)` where text between ![] work like alt attribute in html and between () the link or source to that image, 
while for links we use `[Google](www.google.com)` and like images between [] will be link text and between () will be the link.
to add inline code we use ``.
for syntax highlighting: 
```javascript
if(userIsAsacStudent==true)
{
console.log("you are awesome!");
}
```
you can add emojis, task lists, tables, SHA and so many things
