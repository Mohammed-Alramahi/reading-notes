 | -----------| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| 
 | SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS) (RDBMS)  | NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database.|
 | SQL databases are table based databases   |NoSQL databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column storage|
 | SQL databases have predetermined schema    | NoSQL databases feature dynamic schema for unstructured data|
 | SQL databases are vertically scalable    | NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable  |
 | SQL databases employ SQL for data definition and manipulation.   | NoSQL queries focus on document collection. |

 **What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?**

 Complex query


 **Give a real world example.(SQL)**
 MS-SQL Server Express Edition

 **What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?**
 
 Hierarchical data storage

 **Give a real world example.(NOSQL)**
 
 NoSQL database examples: MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb.

 **Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?**

 NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage.

 **Which type of database is best for scalability?**
 
 SQL databases are vertically scalable, But NoSQL are horizontally scalable.

 ## SQL vs NOSQL 

 **What does SQL stand for?**
 
 SQL: Structuring queries Language used for database communication.

 **What is a realational database?**
 
 A relational database is a form of database which stores and allows access to connected data elements. The relationship data base is based on the relationship model "There has been a mistake.

 **What type of structure does a relational database work with?**

 The logical data structures — the data tables, views and indexes — are independent from the related data-based physical storage structures.

 **What is a ‘schema’?**
 
 Schema is a framework or paradigm for the organization and interpretation of information.

 **What is a NoSQL database?**

 When there is no database, MongoDB builds a database if the database is first stored.

 **How does it work?**

 MongoDB is more versatile rather than SQL.

 **Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.**

 MongoDB is more flexible than SQL. Because NoSQL databases don't have the reliability functions which Relational Databases have.
