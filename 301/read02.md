 # State and Props
 **First of all we have component lifecycle events:**
  - Mounting the component: Whenever we are creating an component and inserting it into DOM this process happen during the mounting phase.
  
  - Updating the component: Whenever a component is being updated or it's state changes then it will be re-rendered and These events occur during updating phase.

  - Unmounting the component: The last phase of the lifecycle is called when we are removing the component from the DOM and it's the only event that happens in this phase.

**The order of events:**

 1. constructor.
 2. render.
 3. componentDidMount
 4. React Updates
 5. componentWillUnmount

 **What types of things can you pass in the props?**

  We can pass anything that works like functions and arguments and inside props we pass it's value like strings, numbers and booleans etc.

 **What is the big difference between props and state?**

 Props is something we pass to component to display some information for example and it's handled outside the component and for the state we take the initial value from the props and then the state gonna upadte the values and it's handled inside a component 
  
 **When do we re-render our application?**

 Whenever the state changes it gonna re-render the application.
